## 📁 Project Overview

### 🧪 Task Breakdown:

1. **Data Analysis Report**  
   - Cleaned and explored player attributes  
   - Identified trends in age, skills, and wages  

2. **Skill-Based Clustering**  
   - Clustered players using key football attributes  
   - Visualized player roles based on similarity

3. **Model Building & Comparison**  
   - Built and evaluated regression models to predict player **Overall Rating**  
   - Compared performance of:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

4. **Insights & EDA**  
   - Found top countries producing footballers  
   - Analyzed player age vs. rating curve  
   - Determined which offensive roles (ST, RW, LW) earn the highest wages
